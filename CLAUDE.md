# CLAUDE.md - Project Context for AI Assistants

## Project Overview

**grakchawwaa-bot** is a Discord bot for Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) guild management. It helps guild leaders and officers monitor guild performance, track member participation, and identify players not meeting expectations.

### About SWGOH

Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is a mobile game where players collect characters and ships to form teams that face various challenges with both PVP and PVE elements. Players join guilds to collaborate in different events:

**Guild Events:**
- **Raids** - PVE battles where each player earns points. Combined guild points unlock reward chests for everyone. Requires 600 tickets per day from guild members to launch.
- **Territory Wars (TW)** - PVP event where two guilds compete. Phase 1: Set defensive teams across 10 zones. Phase 2: Attack opponent's zones. Most points wins.
- **Territory Battles (TB)** - PVE event with multiple phases and zones. Earn up to 3 stars per zone through platoons, combat missions, special missions, and unit deployment.

**Current Bot Features:**
- Track daily ticket contributions (600 tickets/day expected per player)
- Monitor guild member anniversaries
- Link Discord users to SWGOH ally codes
- Generate violation reports for underperforming members

**Planned Features:**
- Raid performance tracking and reporting
- Territory War participation monitoring
- Territory Battle coordination and tracking
- Combat mission completion analysis
- Special mission tracking
- Platoon contribution monitoring

```

### Monorepo Architecture

The project uses a **pnpm workspace** to share code between multiple applications:

- **@grakchawwaa/core**: Framework-agnostic database layer and business logic
  - MikroORM entities, repositories, and migrations
  - Utility functions (ally code handling)
  - Can be shared by Discord bot, web app, and background worker
  - No dependencies on Discord.js or other framework-specific code

- **@grakchawwaa/discord-bot**: Discord bot that imports from core
  - Discord-specific presentation layer
  - Commands and services that use core repositories
  - Sapphire framework integration

- **@grakchawwaa/web**: Future web app for guild management (placeholder)
  - Will import from core for database access
  - Next.js or similar web framework

- **@grakchawwaa/worker**: Future background worker for scheduled tasks (placeholder)
  - Will import from core for database access
  - Handles periodic guild data syncing, report generation, etc.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Ticket Collection Monitoring (Implemented)
**Purpose:** Ensure guild members contribute their daily 600 tickets needed to launch raids.

**How it works:**
- Monitors guild members' ticket contributions via Comlink API
- Posts daily summaries to configured Discord channel
- Tracks violations (players with <600 tickets)
- Generates weekly/monthly violation reports
- Sends reminders before ticket reset time

**Technical details:**
- Runs periodic checks (every 6 hours in dev mode, 2 hours before reset in production)
- Stores violation history in `ticketViolations` table
- Uses JSONB to store per-player ticket counts

### 2. Anniversary Notifications (Implemented)
**Purpose:** Celebrate player milestones to build guild community.

**How it works:**
- Tracks when players joined their guild (via `guildJoinTime` from Comlink)
- Checks daily for guild anniversaries
- Posts celebration messages to configured channel

### 3. Guild Member Management (Implemented)
**Purpose:** Link Discord users to their SWGOH accounts for tracking.

**How it works:**
- Player registration via `/register-player` command
- Links Discord ID to SWGOH ally code (9-digit game identifier)
- Supports multiple ally codes per user (main + alt accounts)
- Each ally code stored as separate Player record with `isMain` flag
- Fetches guild member lists via `/get-guild-members`

### 4. Future Features (Not Yet Implemented)

**Raid Tracking:**
- Monitor individual player raid scores
- Identify players not participating
- Track damage contributions over time
- Generate performance reports

**Territory War Monitoring:**
- Track defensive team placement
- Monitor attack participation
- Analyze win/loss ratios per player
- Zone conquest tracking

**Territory Battle Coordination:**
- Combat mission completion tracking
- Special mission assignments and tracking
- Platoon contribution monitoring
- Deployment participation per phase/zone
- Star progress tracking per zone

## Key Services

### TicketMonitorService
- Runs periodic checks (every 6 hours)
- Fetches guild data from Comlink API
- Identifies ticket violations
- Posts summaries to Discord

### AnniversaryMonitorService
- Checks for player guild anniversaries
- Posts celebration messages

### ViolationSummaryService
- Formats violation reports

## Database Schema

The application uses **MikroORM** for database access with TypeScript entities and custom repositories.

### Tables
- `players` - Individual ally code registrations (PK: ally_code)
  - Links Discord users to SWGOH ally codes
  - Supports main + alt accounts via `is_main` flag
  - Partial unique constraint: one main player per Discord user
- `guilds` - Guild configurations and notification channels (PK: id)
  - Stores SWGOH guild ID (base64-encoded, varchar(24))
  - Discord channel IDs for notifications (varchar(20))
  - Next ticket refresh timestamp (timestamptz)
- `guild_members` - Guild membership tracking (Composite PK: guild_id, ally_code)
  - Join table between guilds and players
  - Soft delete support with `is_active` flag and `left_at` timestamp
  - Tracks member join/leave history
- `ticketViolations` - Historical ticket violation records
- `mikro_orm_migrations` - Migration tracking

### Entities (in @grakchawwaa/core)
- `Player` ([packages/core/src/entities/Player.entity.ts](packages/core/src/entities/Player.entity.ts))
  - PK: ally_code (varchar(9))
  - Fields: discord_id, name, is_main, registered_at
- `Guild` ([packages/core/src/entities/Guild.entity.ts](packages/core/src/entities/Guild.entity.ts))
  - PK: id (varchar(24) - SWGOH guild ID)
  - Fields: name, ticket_collection_channel_id, ticket_reminder_channel_id, anniversary_channel_id, next_ticket_collection_refresh_time
- `GuildMember` ([packages/core/src/entities/GuildMember.entity.ts](packages/core/src/entities/GuildMember.entity.ts))
  - Composite PK: guild_id, ally_code
  - Fields: joined_at, left_at, is_active
- `TicketViolation` ([packages/core/src/entities/TicketViolation.entity.ts](packages/core/src/entities/TicketViolation.entity.ts))

### Repositories (in @grakchawwaa/core)
Custom repositories extend `EntityRepository` with domain-specific methods:
- `PlayerRepository` - Player registration, main/alt account management
  - `getMainPlayer(discordId)` - Get user's main account
  - `getAllPlayers(discordId)` - Get all accounts (main + alts)
  - `addUser(discordId, allyCode, isMain)` - Register player
  - `removeAllyCode(allyCode)` - Remove specific account
  - Accepts `discordId: string` for framework independence
- `GuildRepository` - Guild channel configuration
  - `registerTicketCollectionChannel()` - Setup ticket monitoring
  - `registerAnniversaryChannel()` - Setup anniversary notifications
  - Converts Unix timestamp strings to Date objects
- `GuildMemberRepository` - Guild membership management
  - `addMember(guildId, allyCode)` - Add member to guild
  - `removeMember(guildId, allyCode)` - Soft delete member
  - `getActiveMembers(guildId)` - Get current members
  - `getAllMembers(guildId)` - Get all including historical
- `TicketViolationRepository` - Violation tracking and reporting

## Important Notes

1. **Comlink Dependency:** The bot requires a self-hosted SWGOH Comlink instance. This is an unofficial API that extracts game data directly from EA's servers. Key data retrieved:
   - Player data: ally codes, guild membership, ticket counts
   - Guild data: member lists, guild IDs, event participation
   - Event data: raid scores, TW/TB progress (planned features)
   - See: https://github.com/swgoh-utils/swgoh-comlink

2. **Heroku Deployment:**
   - Runs as worker dyno (not web)
   - Must scale web dyno to 0: `pnpm heroku-scale-web-zero`
   - See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for details

3. **Discord Bot Setup:**
   - Create application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Enable these intents in Bot settings:
     - ✅ Message Content Intent (privileged)
     - ✅ Server Members Intent
     - ✅ Presence Intent
   - Generate OAuth2 invite URL with `bot` + `applications.commands` scopes

4. **Rate Limiting:** The bot implements caching to avoid hitting Comlink rate limits

5. **Legal Docs:** Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are published via GitHub Pages (see [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md))

6. **Commit Messages:** This project uses conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)

## Commands (Slash Commands)

All commands are registered as Discord slash commands using the Sapphire framework.

### Guild Commands
- `/register-ticket-collection` - Start monitoring ticket collection
- `/unregister-ticket-collection` - Stop monitoring
- `/register-anniversary-channel` - Setup anniversary notifications
- `/unregister-anniversary-channel` - Remove notifications
- `/get-guild-members` - List all guild members

### Player Commands
- `/register-player` - Link Discord user to ally code
- `/unregister-player` - Remove player registration
- `/identify` - Show registered player info

### Utility Commands
- `/ping` - Bot health check

## Code Patterns

### Sapphire Framework
The bot uses Sapphire's command structure:
- Commands are classes extending `Command` from `@sapphire/framework`
- Placed in `src/commands/` directory
- Auto-discovered and registered

### Database Access
- Uses **MikroORM** for type-safe database operations
- Entities defined with decorators in `packages/core/src/entities/`
- Custom repositories in `packages/core/src/repositories/`
- Migration-based schema management in core package
- Framework-agnostic core package exports entities, repositories, and initialization
- Discord bot imports from `@grakchawwaa/core` and injects into Sapphire container

### Service Pattern
- Services encapsulate business logic
- Initialized in `index.ts`
- Use dependency injection where applicable

## Testing Strategy

- Jest for unit/integration tests
- Tests colocated with source in `__tests__/` directories
- Test files mirror source structure
- Coverage tracking enabled

## Contributing

1. Follow existing code patterns
2. Use TypeScript strict mode
3. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` before committing
4. Add tests for new features
5. Update this file if adding major features/changes
